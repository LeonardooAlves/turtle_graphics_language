# Turtle Graphics Project

## Project Description

The Turtle Graphics Project implements a turtle graphics system, a key feature in many learning environments for programming. This system allows users to create drawings and patterns using simple commands that control a "turtle" on a canvas. This project is structured to offer both example scripts and a framework for users to create their own turtle-based drawings.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib library (for drawing capabilities)

To install the required library, run:
```bash
pip install matplotlib
```
You might need to use `pip3` instead if you are using a MacBook.

## Features of the Turtle Graphics Project

1. **Turtle Movement**: Includes forward and backward movements, allowing the turtle to navigate the canvas.
2. **Directional Control**: The turtle can turn left or right, adjusting its heading angle.
3. **Pen Control**: Offers the ability to lift or drop the pen, enabling or disabling drawing as the turtle moves.
4. **Drawing Circles**: A dedicated method to draw circular arcs of specified radius and extent.
5. **Customisable Appearance**: Users can change the turtle's line colour and thickness and the colour of the turtle's symbol representation on the canvas.
6. **Position Tracking**: The turtle's current position can be retrieved, which is useful for complex drawings or tracking movements.
7. **Drawing Data Storage**: The turtle records its drawn paths for potential rendering or analysis.
8. **Reset Functionality**: Allows resetting the turtle to its initial state, clearing its drawing history.
9. **Direct Navigation**: Provides a `goto` method for direct movement to specified coordinates, bypassing incremental steps.
10. **Screen Boundary Enforcement**: The turtle's movements are constrained within defined screen limits, ensuring it stays within the visible area.

## Implementing Your Turtle Drawing

To create your turtle drawing:
1. **The exercise of this interview is available**. Open your `cmd` prompt/terminal, navigate to the project's root directory using `cd /path/to/root_directory`, and from the root directory you can run it by typing:
```bash
python interview_exercise.py`
You might need to use `python3` instead if you are using a MacBook.
2. Alternatively, you can edit the `my_turtle_template.py` file in the root directory. This file is set up so you can start coding with the Turtle class immediately. You can run it from the root directory by typing `python my_turtle_template.py`.
2. Alternatively, you can create new Python files in the root directory. Make sure to import the Turtle class from the `turtle_graphics` package.

## Running Examples

The `examples/` directory contains pre-written example scripts demonstrating different capabilities of the Turtle class.

To run an example, navigate to the project's root directory and execute:
```bash
python -m examples.example_1
```
Replace `example_1` with the name of the example you want to run.

## Running Tests

The `tests/` folder contains unit tests for both the Turtle class (`test_turtle.py`) and the drawing functionality (`test_drawing.py`).

To run the tests, use the following command from the project's root directory:
```bash
python -m unittest tests.test_turtle
```
Replace `test_turtle` with `test_drawing` to run the tests for the drawing functionality.

### About the Tests

- `test_turtle.py`: Contains tests for various methods of the Turtle class, ensuring correct movement, pen control, and other functionalities.
- `test_drawing.py`: Tests the drawing output of the Turtle class, validating the correct rendering of lines and shapes.

## Next Steps: suggested modifications for students

1. User Inputs for Turtle Movements: consider enhancing the system by allowing user inputs to define turtle movements. For example, using command-line inputs or GUI-based controls.

2. Ensure that SOLID principles are followed for OOP implementations. Currently, this project follows only the Single-Responsability Principle (SRP). Adding other applicable principles, such as the Open-Closed Principle (OCP), is recommended. OCP will also bring OOP abstraction to the project.

3. Write a comprehensive documentation covering setup, usage, examples, and detailed explanation of computational thinking.

4. Optimisation Techniques: as the complexity of the drawings increases, consider implementing optimisation techniques:
- Batch processing of drawing commands.
- Efficient data structures for storing line data.
- Using GPU-based libraries for rendering.

5. Alternative Graphics Methods: while currently using Matplotlib for graphics, exploring other libraries like Pygame, OpenCV, or even web-based technologies like HTML5 Canvas (for a web version) could offer different capabilities and performance characteristics.

## Good Practices followed for this project to be kept for the next steps

1. **Modular Design**: The project is structured into separate modules, enhancing readability and maintainability.

2. **Clean Code**: The code is written clearly and concisely, making it easy to understand and modify.

3. **Documentation**: Each class and method is well-documented with docstrings, comments, and annotations, providing clear descriptions and usage instructions. Readme files are also provided with brief explanations. *A full written documentation is under development*.

4. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling is implemented to manage incorrect inputs and edge cases effectively. Besides, the straightforward naming convention improves user experience.

5. **Code Consistency**: Consistent naming conventions and coding styles are maintained throughout the project, ensuring uniformity.

6. **Encapsulation**: The project uses encapsulation to hide complex implementation details, providing a simple interface for users.

7. **Testing**: Comprehensive test cases cover various functionalities, ensuring the reliability and stability of the code.

8. **Scalability and Flexibility**: The design allows for adding new features and functionalities easily.

9. **Adherence to Standards**: The project follows standard programming practices and guidelines, such as PEP8 for Python. Besides, each class and method has a single, well-defined purpose, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

These practices enhance code quality by increasing readability, maintainability, and usability.
